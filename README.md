This is a practise file for Customer Fraud Analysis in which EDA, models and Some Questions were answered.

Due to high Instances, the size of the dataset was too large and due to which it was not loaded properly.

IT was purely made for practise to create different models and check.

Data Preprocessing, model creation, question answer discussions etc were done.

Thank you,
